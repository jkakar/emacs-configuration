.SH NAME
heart \- Heartbeat Monitoring of an Erlang Runtime System
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This modules contains the interface to the \fIheart\fR\& process\&. \fIheart\fR\& sends periodic heartbeats to an external port program, which is also named \fIheart\fR\&\&. The purpose of the heart port program is to check that the Erlang runtime system it is supervising is still running\&. If the port program has not received any heartbeats within \fIHEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT\fR\& seconds (default is 60 seconds), the system can be rebooted\&. Also, if the system is equipped with a hardware watchdog timer and is running Solaris, the watchdog can be used to supervise the entire system\&.
.LP
An Erlang runtime system to be monitored by a heart program, should be started with the command line flag \fI-heart\fR\& (see also \fBerl(1)\fR\&)\&. The \fIheart\fR\& process is then started automatically:
.LP
.nf

% erl -heart \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.LP
If the system should be rebooted because of missing heart-beats, or a terminated Erlang runtime system, the environment variable \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR\& has to be set before the system is started\&. If this variable is not set, a warning text will be printed but the system will not reboot\&. However, if the hardware watchdog is used, it will trigger a reboot \fIHEART_BEAT_BOOT_DELAY\fR\& seconds later nevertheless (default is 60)\&.
.LP
To reboot on the WINDOWS platform \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR\& can be set to \fIheart -shutdown\fR\& (included in the Erlang delivery) or of course to any other suitable program which can activate a reboot\&.
.LP
The hardware watchdog will not be started under Solaris if the environment variable \fIHW_WD_DISABLE\fR\& is set\&.
.LP
The \fIHEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT\fR\& and \fIHEART_BEAT_BOOT_DELAY\fR\& environment variables can be used to configure the heart timeouts, they can be set in the operating system shell before Erlang is started or be specified at the command line:
.LP
.nf

% erl -heart -env HEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT 30 \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.LP
The value (in seconds) must be in the range 10 < X <= 65535\&.
.LP
It should be noted that if the system clock is adjusted with more than \fIHEART_BEAT_TIMEOUT\fR\& seconds, \fIheart\fR\& will timeout and try to reboot the system\&. This can happen, for example, if the system clock is adjusted automatically by use of NTP (Network Time Protocol)\&.
.LP
If a crash occurs, an \fIerl_crash\&.dump\fR\& will \fInot\fR\& be written unless the environment variable \fIERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS\fR\& is set\&.
.LP
.nf

% erl -heart -env ERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS 10 \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.LP
Furthermore, \fIERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS\fR\& has the following behaviour on \fIheart\fR\&:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=0\fR\&:
Suppresses the writing a crash dump file entirely, thus rebooting the runtime system immediately\&. This is the same as not setting the environment variable\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=-1\fR\&:
Setting the environment variable to a negative value will not reboot the runtime system until the crash dump file has been completly written\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIERL_CRASH_DUMP_SECONDS=S\fR\&:
Heart will wait for \fIS\fR\& seconds to let the crash dump file be written\&. After \fIS\fR\& seconds \fIheart\fR\& will reboot the runtime system regardless of the crash dump file has been written or not\&.
.RE
.LP
In the following descriptions, all function fails with reason \fIbadarg\fR\& if \fIheart\fR\& is not started\&.

.LP
Sets a temporary reboot command\&. This command is used if a \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR\& other than the one specified with the environment variable should be used in order to reboot the system\&. The new Erlang runtime system will (if it misbehaves) use the environment variable \fIHEART_COMMAND\fR\& to reboot\&.
.LP
Limitations: The \fICmd\fR\& command string will be sent to the heart program as a ISO-latin-1 or UTF-8 encoded binary depending on the file name encoding mode of the emulator (see \fB\fIfile:native_name_encoding/0\fR\&\fR\&)\&. The size of the encoded binary must be less than 2047 bytes\&.

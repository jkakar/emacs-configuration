erl_driver \- API functions for an Erlang driver
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
An Erlang driver is a library containing a set of native driver callback functions that the Erlang VM calls when certain events occur\&. There may be multiple instances of a driver, each instance is associated with an Erlang port\&.

.LP
A driver callback is executed as a direct extension of the native code of the VM\&. Execution is not made in a safe environment\&. The VM can \fInot\fR\& provide the same services as provided when executing Erlang code, such as preemptive scheduling or memory protection\&. If the driver callback function doesn\&'t behave well, the whole VM will misbehave\&.
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
A driver callback that crash will crash the whole VM\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
An erroneously implemented driver callback might cause a VM internal state inconsistency which may cause a crash of the VM, or miscellaneous misbehaviors of the VM at any point after the call to the driver callback\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A driver callback that do \fBlengthy work\fR\& before returning will degrade responsiveness of the VM, and may cause miscellaneous strange behaviors\&. Such strange behaviors include, but are not limited to, extreme memory usage, and bad load balancing between schedulers\&. Strange behaviors that might occur due to lengthy work may also vary between OTP releases\&.

.LP
As of erts version 5\&.5\&.3 the driver interface has been extended (see \fBextended marker\fR\&)\&. The extended interface introduce \fBversion management\fR\&, the possibility to pass capability flags (see \fBdriver flags\fR\&) to the runtime system at driver initialization, and some new driver API functions\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
As of erts version 5\&.9 old drivers have to be recompiled and have to use the extended interface\&. They also have to be adjusted to the \fB64-bit capable driver interface\&. \fR\& 

.LP
The driver calls back to the emulator, using the API functions declared in \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\&\&. They are used for outputting data from the driver, using timers, etc\&.
.LP
Each driver instance is associated with a port\&. Every port has a port owner process\&. Communication with the port is normally done through the port owner process\&. Most of the functions take the \fIport\fR\& handle as an argument\&. This identifies the driver instance\&. Note that this port handle must be stored by the driver, it is not given when the driver is called from the emulator (see \fBdriver_entry\fR\&)\&.
.LP
Some of the functions take a parameter of type \fIErlDrvBinary\fR\&, a driver binary\&. It should be both allocated and freed by the caller\&. Using a binary directly avoids one extra copying of data\&.
.LP
Many of the output functions have a "header buffer", with \fIhbuf\fR\& and \fIhlen\fR\& parameters\&. This buffer is sent as a list before the binary (or list, depending on port mode) that is sent\&. This is convenient when matching on messages received from the port\&. (Although in the latest versions of Erlang, there is the binary syntax, that enables you to match on the beginning of a binary\&.) 
.LP
In the runtime system with SMP support, drivers are locked either on driver level or port level (driver instance level)\&. By default driver level locking will be used, i\&.e\&., only one emulator thread will execute code in the driver at a time\&. If port level locking is used, multiple emulator threads may execute code in the driver at the same time\&. There will only be one thread at a time calling driver call-backs corresponding to the same port, though\&. In order to enable port level locking set the \fIERL_DRV_FLAG_USE_PORT_LOCKING\fR\& \fBdriver flag\fR\& in the \fBdriver_entry\fR\& used by the driver\&. When port level locking is used it is the responsibility of the driver writer to synchronize all accesses to data shared by the ports (driver instances)\&.
.LP
Most drivers written before the runtime system with SMP support existed will be able to run in the runtime system with SMP support without being rewritten if driver level locking is used\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
It is assumed that drivers do not access other drivers\&. If drivers should access each other they have to provide their own mechanism for thread safe synchronization\&. Such "inter driver communication" is strongly discouraged\&.

.LP
Previously, in the runtime system without SMP support, specific driver call-backs were always called from the same thread\&. This is \fInot\fR\& the case in the runtime system with SMP support\&. Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads, e\&.g\&., two consecutive calls to exactly the same call-back for exactly the same port may be made from two different threads\&. This will for \fImost\fR\& drivers not be a problem, but it might\&. Drivers that depend on all call-backs being called in the same thread, \fIhave\fR\& to be rewritten before being used in the runtime system with SMP support\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
Regardless of locking scheme used, calls to driver call-backs may be made from different threads\&.

.LP
Most functions in this API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe, i\&.e\&., they may \fInot\fR\& be called from an arbitrary thread\&. Functions that are not documented as thread-safe may only be called from driver call-backs or function calls descending from a driver call-back call\&. Note that driver call-backs may be called from different threads\&. This, however, is not a problem for any function in this API, since the emulator has control over these threads\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Warning:
.RE
Functions not explicitly documented as thread safe are \fInot\fR\& thread safe\&. Also note that some functions are \fIonly\fR\& thread safe when used in a runtime system with SMP support\&.
.LP
A function not explicitly documented as thread safe may at some point in time have a thread safe implementation in the runtime system\&. Such an implementation may however change to a thread \fIunsafe\fR\& implementation at any time \fIwithout any notice\fR\& at all\&.
.LP
\fIOnly use functions explicitly documented as thread safe from arbitrary threads\&.\fR\&

.LP
As mentioned in the \fBwarning\fR\& text at the beginning of this document it is of vital importance that a driver callback does return relatively fast\&. It is hard to give an exact maximum amount of time that a driver callback is allowed to work, but as a rule of thumb a well behaving driver callback should return before a millisecond has passed\&. This can be achieved using different approaches\&. If you have full control over the code that are to execute in the driver callback, the best approach is to divide the work into multiple chunks of work and trigger multiple calls to the \fBtimeout callback\fR\& using zero timeouts\&. The \fB\fIerl_drv_consume_timeslice()\fR\&\fR\& function can be useful in order to determine when to trigger such timeout callback calls\&. It might, however, not always be possible to implement it this way, e\&.g\&. when calling third party libraries\&. In this case you typically want to dispatch the work to another thread\&. Information about thread primitives can be found below\&.
.SH "FUNCTIONALITY"

.LP
All functions that a driver needs to do with Erlang are performed through driver API functions\&. There are functions for the following functionality:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
Timer functions:
Timer functions are used to control the timer that a driver may use\&. The timer will have the emulator call the \fBtimeout\fR\& entry function after a specified time\&. Only one timer is available for each driver instance\&.
.TP 2
.B
Queue handling:
Every driver instance has an associated queue\&. This queue is a \fISysIOVec\fR\& that works as a buffer\&. It\&'s mostly used for the driver to buffer data that should be written to a device, it is a byte stream\&. If the port owner process closes the driver, and the queue is not empty, the driver will not be closed\&. This enables the driver to flush its buffers before closing\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The queue can be manipulated from arbitrary threads if a port data lock is used\&. See documentation of the \fBErlDrvPDL\fR\& type for more information\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
Output functions:
With the output functions, the driver sends data back to the emulator\&. They will be received as messages by the port owner process, see \fIopen_port/2\fR\&\&. The vector function and the function taking a driver binary are faster, because they avoid copying the data buffer\&. There is also a fast way of sending terms from the driver, without going through the binary term format\&.
.TP 2
.B
Failure:
The driver can exit and signal errors up to Erlang\&. This is only for severe errors, when the driver can\&'t possibly keep open\&.
.TP 2
.B
Asynchronous calls:
The latest Erlang versions (R7B and later) has provision for asynchronous function calls, using a thread pool provided by Erlang\&. There is also a select call, that can be used for asynchronous drivers\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fBMulti-threading\fR\&:
A POSIX thread like API for multi-threading is provided\&. The Erlang driver thread API only provide a subset of the functionality provided by the POSIX thread API\&. The subset provided is more or less the basic functionality needed for multi-threaded programming:

The Erlang driver thread API can be used in conjunction with the POSIX thread API on UN-ices and with the Windows native thread API on Windows\&. The Erlang driver thread API has the advantage of being portable, but there might exist situations where you want to use functionality from the POSIX thread API or the Windows native thread API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The Erlang driver thread API only returns error codes when it is reasonable to recover from an error condition\&. If it isn\&'t reasonable to recover from an error condition, the whole runtime system is terminated\&. For example, if a create mutex operation fails, an error code is returned, but if a lock operation on a mutex fails, the whole runtime system is terminated\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Note that there exists no "condition variable wait with timeout" in the Erlang driver thread API\&. This is due to issues with \fIpthread_cond_timedwait()\fR\&\&. When the system clock suddenly is changed, it isn\&'t always guaranteed that you will wake up from the call as expected\&. An Erlang runtime system has to be able to cope with sudden changes of the system clock\&. Therefore, we have omitted it from the Erlang driver thread API\&. In the Erlang driver case, timeouts can and should be handled with the timer functionality of the Erlang driver API\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
In order for the Erlang driver thread API to function, thread support has to be enabled in the runtime system\&. An Erlang driver can check if thread support is enabled by use of \fBdriver_system_info()\fR\&\&. Note that some functions in the Erlang driver API are thread-safe only when the runtime system has SMP support, also this information can be retrieved via \fBdriver_system_info()\fR\&\&. Also note that a lot of functions in the Erlang driver API are \fInot\fR\& thread-safe regardless of whether SMP support is enabled or not\&. If a function isn\&'t documented as thread-safe it is \fInot\fR\& thread-safe\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
\fINOTE\fR\&: When executing in an emulator thread, it is \fIvery important\fR\& that you unlock \fIall\fR\& locks you have locked before letting the thread out of your control; otherwise, you are \fIvery likely\fR\& to deadlock the whole emulator\&. If you need to use thread specific data in an emulator thread, only have the thread specific data set while the thread is under your control, and clear the thread specific data before you let the thread out of your control\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
In the future there will probably be debug functionality integrated with the Erlang driver thread API\&. All functions that create entities take a \fIname\fR\& argument\&. Currently the \fIname\fR\& argument is unused, but it will be used when the debug functionality has been implemented\&. If you name all entities created well, the debug functionality will be able to give you better error reports\&.
.RE
.TP 2

Adding / removing drivers:
A driver can add and later remove drivers\&.
.TP 2
.B
Monitoring processes:
A driver can monitor a process that does not own a port\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fBVersion management\fR\&:
Version management is enabled for drivers that have set the \fBextended_marker\fR\& field of their \fBdriver_entry\fR\& to \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&\&. \fIerl_driver\&.h\fR\& defines \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MARKER\fR\&, \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\&, and \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION\fR\&\&. \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\& will be incremented when driver incompatible changes are made to the Erlang runtime system\&. Normally it will suffice to recompile drivers when the \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MAJOR_VERSION\fR\& has changed, but it could, under rare circumstances, mean that drivers have to be slightly modified\&. If so, this will of course be documented\&. \fIERL_DRV_EXTENDED_MINOR_VERSION\fR\& will be incremented when new features are added\&. The runtime system uses the minor version of the driver to determine what features to use\&. The runtime system will normally refuse to load a driver if the major versions differ, or if the major versions are equal and the minor version used by the driver is greater than the one used by the runtime system\&. Old drivers with lower major versions will however be allowed after a bump of the major version during a transition period of two major releases\&. Such old drivers might however fail if deprecated features are used\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The emulator will refuse to load a driver that does not use the extended driver interface, to allow for 64-bit capable drivers, since incompatible type changes for the callbacks \fBoutput\fR\&, \fBcontrol\fR\& and \fBcall\fR\& were introduced in release R15B\&. A driver written with the old types would compile with warnings and when called return garbage sizes to the emulator causing it to read random memory and create huge incorrect result blobs\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Therefore it is not enough to just recompile drivers written with version management for pre-R15B types; the types have to be changed in the driver suggesting other rewrites especially regarding size variables\&. Investigate all warnings when recompiling!
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Also, the API driver functions \fIdriver_output*\fR\&, \fIdriver_vec_to_buf\fR\&, \fIdriver_alloc/realloc*\fR\& and the \fIdriver_*\fR\& queue functions were changed to have larger length arguments and return values\&. This is a lesser problem since code that passes smaller types will get them auto converted in the calls and as long as the driver does not handle sizes that overflow an \fIint\fR\& all will work as before\&.

      REWRITES FOR 64-BIT DRIVER INTERFACE

.LP
For erts-5\&.9 two new integer types \fBErlDrvSizeT\fR\& and \fBErlDrvSSizeT\fR\& were introduced that can hold 64-bit sizes if necessary\&.
.LP
To not update a driver and just recompile it probably works when building for a 32-bit machine creating a false sense of security\&. Hopefully that will generate many important warnings\&. But when recompiling the same driver later on for a 64-bit machine there \fIwill\fR\& be warnings and almost certainly crashes\&. So it is a BAD idea to postpone updating the driver and not fixing the warnings!
.LP
When recompiling with \fIgcc\fR\& use the \fI-Wstrict-prototypes\fR\& flag to get better warnings\&. Try to find a similar flag if you are using some other compiler\&.

Here follows a checklist for rewriting a pre erts-5\&.9 driver, most important first\&.

If certain port specific data have to be accessed from other threads than those calling the driver call-backs, a port data lock can be used in order to synchronize the operations on the data\&.

Normally a driver instance does not have a port data lock\&.

A port data lock is reference counted, and when the reference count reaches zero, it will be destroyed\&. The emulator will at least increment the reference count once when the lock is created and decrement it once when the port associated with the lock terminates\&. The emulator will also increment the reference count when an async job is enqueued and decrement it after an async job has been invoked\&. Besides this, it is the responsibility of the driver to ensure that the reference count does not reach zero before the last use of the lock by the driver has been made\&. The reference count can be read, incremented, and decremented, respectively, by use of \fBdriver_pdl_get_refc()\fR\&, \fBdriver_pdl_inc_refc()\fR\&, and \fBdriver_pdl_dec_refc()\fR\&\&.

\fIERL_DRV_USE\fR\& specifies if we are using the event object or if we want to close it\&. On an emulator with SMP support, it is not safe to clear all events and then close the event object after \fIdriver_select\fR\& has returned\&. Another thread may still be using the event object internally\&. To safely close an event object call \fIdriver_select\fR\& with \fIERL_DRV_USE\fR\& and \fIon==0\fR\&\&. That will clear all events and then call \fBstop_select\fR\& when it is safe to close the event object\&. \fIERL_DRV_USE\fR\& should be set together with the first event for an event object\&. It is harmless to set \fIERL_DRV_USE\fR\& even though it already has been done\&.

\fIowner_pid\fR\&:
The process id of the Erlang process which will be owner of the new port\&. This process will be linked to the new port\&. You usually want to use \fIdriver_caller(port)\fR\& as \fIowner_pid\fR\&\&.
.TP 2

.TP 2
.B
\fIdrv_data\fR\&:
The driver defined handle that will be passed in subsequent calls to driver call-backs\&. Note, that the \fBdriver start call-back\fR\& will not be called for this new driver instance\&. The driver defined handle is normally created in the \fBdriver start call-back\fR\& when a port is created via \fBerlang:open_port/2\fR\&\&.

Give the runtime system a hint about how much CPU time the current driver callback call has consumed since last hint, or since the start of the callback if no previous hint has been given\&.

Note that it is up to the runtime system to determine if and how to use this information\&.

This function is provided to better support co-operative scheduling, improve system responsiveness, and to make it easier to prevent misbehaviors of the VM due to a port monopolizing a scheduler thread\&. It can be used when dividing length work into a number of repeated driver callback calls without the need to use threads\&. Also see the important \fBwarning\fR\& text at the beginning of this document\&.

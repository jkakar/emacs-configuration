.SH NAME
orber_acl \- Orber ACL operations
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module contains functions intended for analyzing Access Control List (ACL) filters\&. The filters uses a extended format of Classless Inter Domain Routing (CIDR)\&. For example, \fI"123\&.123\&.123\&.10"\fR\& limits the connection to that particular host, while \fI"123\&.123\&.123\&.10/17"\fR\& allows connections to or from any host equal to the 17 most significant bits\&. Orber also allow the user to specify a certain port or port range, for example, \fI"123\&.123\&.123\&.10/17#4001"\fR\& and \fI"123\&.123\&.123\&.10/17#4001/5001"\fR\& respectively\&. IPv4 or none compressed IPv6 strings are accepted\&.

If \fIGetInfo\fR\& is not supplied or set to false, this operation returns a boolean which tells if the IPv4 or IPv6 address would pass the ACL filter, defined by the \fIiiop_acl\fR\& configuration parameter, or not\&. When \fIGetInfo\fR\& is set to true, a tuple which, besides the boolean that tells if access was granted, also include the defined interfaces and port(s)\&. This operation requires that Orber is running and can be used on a live node to determine if Orber has been properly configured\&.

This operation returns true if the IPv4 or IPv6 address would pass the supplied ACL\&. If that is not the case, a tuple containing the accepted range is returned\&. This operation should only be used for test purposes\&.

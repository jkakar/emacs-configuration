mnesia \- A Distributed Telecommunications DBMS 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
\fIMnesia\fR\& is a distributed DataBase Management System (DBMS), appropriate for telecommunications applications and other Erlang applications which require continuous operation and exhibit soft real-time properties\&.
.LP
Listed below are some of the most important and attractive capabilities, Mnesia provides:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
A relational/object hybrid data model which is suitable for telecommunications applications\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
A specifically designed DBMS query language, QLC (as an add-on library)\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Persistence\&. Tables may be coherently kept on disc as well as in main memory\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Replication\&. Tables may be replicated at several nodes\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Atomic transactions\&. A series of table manipulation operations can be grouped into a single atomic transaction\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Location transparency\&. Programs can be written without knowledge of the actual location of data\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Extremely fast real time data searches\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
Schema manipulation routines\&. It is possible to reconfigure the DBMS at runtime without stopping the system\&.

.LP
This Reference Manual describes the Mnesia API\&. This includes functions used to define and manipulate Mnesia tables\&.
.LP
All functions documented in these pages can be used in any combination with queries using the list comprehension notation\&. The query notation is described in the QLC\&'s man page\&.
.LP
Data in Mnesia is organized as a set of tables\&. Each table has a name which must be an atom\&. Each table is made up of Erlang records\&. The user is responsible for the record definitions\&. Each table also has a set of properties\&. Below are some of the properties that are associated with each table:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fItype\fR\&\&. Each table can either have \&'set\&', \&'ordered_set\&' or \&'bag\&' semantics\&. Note: currently \&'ordered_set\&' is not supported for \&'disc_only_copies\&'\&. If a table is of type \&'set\&' it means that each key leads to either one or zero records\&. 
.br
If a new item is inserted with the same key as an existing record, the old record is overwritten\&. On the other hand, if a table is of type \&'bag\&', each key can map to several records\&. However, all records in type bag tables are unique, only the keys may be duplicated\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIrecord_name\fR\&\&. All records stored in a table must have the same name\&. You may say that the records must be instances of the same record type\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIram_copies\fR\& A table can be replicated on a number of Erlang nodes\&. The \fIram_copies\fR\& property specifies a list of Erlang nodes where RAM copies are kept\&. These copies can be dumped to disc at regular intervals\&. However, updates to these copies are not written to disc on a transaction basis\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIdisc_copies\fR\& The \fIdisc_copies\fR\& property specifies a list of Erlang nodes where the table is kept in RAM as well as on disc\&. All updates of the table are performed on the actual table and are also logged to disc\&. If a table is of type \fIdisc_copies\fR\& at a certain node, it means that the entire table is resident in RAM memory as well as on disc\&. Each transaction performed on the table is appended to a LOG file as well as written into the RAM table\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIdisc_only_copies\fR\& Some, or all, table replicas can be kept on disc only\&. These replicas are considerably slower than the RAM based replicas\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIindex\fR\& This is a list of attribute names, or integers, which specify the tuple positions on which Mnesia shall build and maintain an extra index table\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIlocal_content\fR\& When an application requires tables whose contents is local to each node, \fIlocal_content\fR\& tables may be used\&. The name of the table is known to all Mnesia nodes, but its contents is unique on each node\&. This means that access to such a table must be done locally\&. Set the \fIlocal_content\fR\& field to \fItrue\fR\& if you want to enable the \fIlocal_content\fR\& behavior\&. The default is \fIfalse\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fImajority\fR\& This attribute can be either \fItrue\fR\& or \fIfalse\fR\& (default is \fIfalse\fR\&)\&. When \fItrue\fR\&, a majority of the table replicas must be available for an update to succeed\&. Majority checking can be enabled on tables with mission-critical data, where it is vital to avoid inconsistencies due to network splits\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIsnmp\fR\& Each (set based) Mnesia table can be automatically turned into an SNMP ordered table as well\&. This property specifies the types of the SNMP keys\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fIattributes\fR\&\&. The names of the attributes for the records that are inserted in the table\&.
.LP
.RE

.LP
See \fImnesia:create_table/2\fR\& about the complete set of table properties and their details\&.
.LP
This document uses a table of persons to illustrate various examples\&. The following record definition is assumed:
.LP
.nf

-record(person, {name,
                 age = 0,
                 address = unknown,
                 salary = 0,
                 children = []}),
    
.fi
.LP
The first attribute of the record is the primary key, or key for short\&.
.LP
The function descriptions are sorted in alphabetic order\&. \fIHint:\fR\& start to read about \fImnesia:create_table/2\fR\&, \fImnesia:lock/2\fR\& and \fImnesia:activity/4\fR\& before you continue on and learn about the rest\&.
.LP
Writing or deleting in transaction context creates a local copy of each modified record during the transaction\&. During iteration, i\&.e\&. \fImnesia:fold[lr]/4\fR\& \fImnesia:next/2\fR\& \fImnesia:prev/2\fR\& \fImnesia:snmp_get_next_index/2\fR\&, mnesia will compensate for every written or deleted record, which may reduce the performance\&. If possible avoid writing or deleting records in the same transaction before iterating over the table\&.
.SH EXPORTS
.LP

abort(Reason) -> transaction abort 
.br
.RS
.LP
Makes the transaction silently return the tuple \fI{aborted, Reason}\fR\&\&. The abortion of a Mnesia transaction means that an exception will be thrown to an enclosing \fIcatch\fR\&\&. Thus, the expression \fIcatch mnesia:abort(x)\fR\& does not abort the transaction\&.
.RE

.B
activate_checkpoint(Args) -> {ok,Name,Nodes} | {error,Reason}
.br
.RS
.LP
A checkpoint is a consistent view of the system\&. A checkpoint can be activated on a set of tables\&. This checkpoint can then be traversed and will present a view of the system as it existed at the time when the checkpoint was activated, even if the tables are being or have been manipulated\&.
.LP
\fIArgs\fR\& is a list of the following tuples:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
\fI{name,Name}\fR\&\&. \fIName\fR\& of checkpoint\&. Each checkpoint must have a name which is unique to the associated nodes\&. The name can be reused only once the checkpoint has been deactivated\&. By default, a name which is probably unique is generated\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI{max,MaxTabs}\fR\&\&. \fIMaxTabs\fR\& is a list of tables that should be included in the checkpoint\&. The default is []\&. For these tables, the redundancy will be maximized and checkpoint information will be retained together with all replicas\&. The checkpoint becomes more fault tolerant if the tables have several replicas\&. When a new replica is added by means of the schema manipulation function \fImnesia:add_table_copy/3\fR\&, a retainer will also be attached automatically\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI{min,MinTabs}\fR\&\&. \fIMinTabs\fR\& is a list of tables that should be included in the checkpoint\&. The default is []\&. For these tables, the redundancy will be minimized and the checkpoint information will only be retained with one replica, preferably on the local node\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI{allow_remote,Bool}\fR\&\&. \fIfalse\fR\& means that all retainers must be local\&. The checkpoint cannot be activated if a table does not reside locally\&. \fItrue\fR\& allows retainers to be allocated on any node\&. Default is set to \fItrue\fR\&\&.
.LP
.TP 2
*
\fI{ram_overrides_dump,Bool}\fR\&\&. Only applicable for \fIram_copies\fR\&\&. \fIBool\fR\& allows you to choose to backup the table state as it is in RAM, or as it is on disc\&. \fItrue\fR\& means that the latest committed records in RAM should be included in the checkpoint\&. These are the records that the application accesses\&. \fIfalse\fR\& means that the records dumped to DAT files should be included in the checkpoint\&. These are the records that will be loaded at startup\&. Default is \fIfalse\fR\&\&.
.LP

Table indices can and should be used whenever the user wants to frequently use some other field than the key field to look up records\&. If this other field has an index associated with it, these lookups can occur in constant time and space\&. For example, if our application wishes to use the age field of persons to efficiently find all person with a specific age, it might be a good idea to have an index on the age field\&. This can be accomplished with the following call:
.LP
.nf

mnesia:add_table_index(person, age)

.LP
Call the \fIFun\fR\& in a context which is not protected by a transaction\&. The Mnesia function calls performed in the \fIFun\fR\& are mapped to the corresponding dirty functions\&. This still involves logging, replication and subscriptions, but there is no locking, local transaction storage, or commit protocols involved\&. Checkpoint retainers and indices are updated, but they will be updated dirty\&. As for normal mnesia:dirty_* operations, the operations are performed semi-asynchronously\&. See \fImnesia:activity/4\fR\& and the Mnesia User\&'s Guide for more details\&.
.LP
It is possible to manipulate the Mnesia tables without using transactions\&. This has some serious disadvantages, but is considerably faster since the transaction manager is not involved and no locks are set\&. A dirty operation does, however, guarantee a certain level of consistency and it is not possible for the dirty operations to return garbled records\&. All dirty operations provide location transparency to the programmer and a program does not have to be aware of the whereabouts of a certain table in order to function\&.
.LP
\fINote:\fR\&It is more than 10 times more efficient to read records dirty than within a transaction\&.
.LP
Depending on the application, it may be a good idea to use the dirty functions for certain operations\&. Almost all Mnesia functions which can be called within transactions have a dirty equivalent which is much more efficient\&. However, it must be noted that it is possible for the database to be left in an inconsistent state if dirty operations are used to update it\&. Dirty operations should only be used for performance reasons when it is absolutely necessary\&.

lock(LockItem, LockKind) -> Nodes | ok | transaction abort
.br
.RS
.LP
Write locks are normally acquired on all nodes where a replica of the table resides (and is active)\&. Read locks are acquired on one node (the local node if a local replica exists)\&. Most of the context sensitive access functions acquire an implicit lock if they are invoked in a transaction context\&. The granularity of a lock may either be a single record or an entire table\&.
.LP
The normal usage is to call the function without checking the return value since it exits if it fails and the transaction is restarted by the transaction manager\&. It returns all the locked nodes if a write lock is acquired, and \fIok\fR\& if it was a read lock\&.
.LP
This function \fImnesia:lock/2\fR\& is intended to support explicit locking on tables but also intended for situations when locks need to be acquired regardless of how tables are replicated\&. Currently, two \fILockKind\fR\&\&'s are supported:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIwrite\fR\&:
Write locks are exclusive, which means that if one transaction manages to acquire a write lock on an item, no other transaction may acquire any kind of lock on the same item\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIread\fR\&:
Read locks may be shared, which means that if one transaction manages to acquire a read lock on an item, other transactions may also acquire a read lock on the same item\&. However, if someone has a read lock no one can acquire a write lock at the same item\&. If some one has a write lock no one can acquire a read lock nor a write lock at the same item\&.
.RE

Conflicting lock requests are automatically queued if there is no risk of a deadlock\&. Otherwise the transaction must be aborted and executed again\&. Mnesia does this automatically as long as the upper limit of maximum \fIretries\fR\& is not reached\&. See \fImnesia:transaction/3\fR\& for the details\&.

When a sticky write lock is acquired, all nodes will be informed which node is locked\&.

This function executes the functional object \fIFun\fR\& with arguments \fIArgs\fR\& as a transaction\&.

The code which executes inside the transaction can consist of a series of table manipulation functions\&. If something goes wrong inside the transaction as a result of a user error or a certain table not being available, the entire transaction is aborted and the function \fItransaction/1\fR\& returns the tuple \fI{aborted, Reason}\fR\&\&.

A function which adds a family to the database can be written as follows if we have a structure \fI{family, Father, Mother, ChildrenList}\fR\&:

oid(Rec) -> {element(1, Rec), element(2, Rec)}.

This code adds a set of people to the database\&. Running this code within one transaction will ensure that either the whole family is added to the database, or the whole transaction aborts\&. For example, if the last child is badly formatted, or the executing process terminates due to an \fI\&'EXIT\&'\fR\& signal while executing the family code, the transaction aborts\&. Accordingly, the situation where half a family is added can never occur\&.
.LP
It is also useful to update the database within a transaction if several processes concurrently update the same records\&. For example, the function \fIraise(Name, Amount)\fR\&, which adds \fIAmount\fR\& to the salary field of a person, should be implemented as follows:
.LP

                P2 = P#person{salary = Salary},

\fI-mnesia schema_location Loc\fR\& controls where Mnesia will look for its schema\&. The parameter \fILoc\fR\& may be one of the following atoms:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIdisc\fR\&:
Mandatory disc\&. The schema is assumed to be located in the Mnesia directory\&. If the schema cannot be found, Mnesia refuses to start\&. This is the old behavior\&.
.TP 2
.B
\fIram\fR\&:
Mandatory RAM\&. The schema resides in RAM only\&. At start-up, a tiny new schema is generated\&. This default schema just contains the definition of the schema table and only resides on the local node\&. Since no other nodes are found in the default schema, the configuration parameter \fIextra_db_nodes\fR\& must be used in order to let the node share its table definitions with other nodes\&. (The \fIextra_db_nodes\fR\& parameter may also be used on disc based nodes\&.)
.TP 2
.B
\fIopt_disc\fR\&:
Optional disc\&. The schema may reside either on disc or in RAM\&. If the schema is found on disc, Mnesia starts as a disc based node and the storage type of the schema table is \fIdisc_copies\fR\&\&. If no schema is found on disc, Mnesia starts as a disc-less node and the storage type of the schema table is \fIram_copies\fR\&\&. The default value for the application parameter is \fIopt_disc\fR\&\&.

First the SASL application parameters are checked, then the command line flags are checked, and finally, the default value is chosen\&.

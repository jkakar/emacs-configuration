.TH CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushConsumer 3 "cosEvent 2.1.15" "Ericsson AB" "Erlang Module Definition"
.SH NAME
CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushConsumer \- This module implements a ProxyPushConsumer interface which acts as a middleman between push supplier and the event channel.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The ProxyPushConsumer interface defines the second step for connecting push suppliers to the event channel\&. A proxy consumer is similar to a normal consumer, but includes an additional method for connecting a supplier to the proxy consumer\&.
.LP
To get access to all definitions, e\&.g\&., exceptions, include necessary \fIhrl\fR\& files by using:
.br
\fI-include_lib("cosEvent/include/*\&.hrl")\&.\fR\&
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPushConsumer interface can perform the following operations:

.LP
This operation connects PushSupplier object to the ProxyPushConsumer object\&. A nil object reference can be passed to this operation\&. If so a channel cannot invoke the disconnect_push_supplier operation on the supplier; the supplier may be disconnected from the channel without being informed\&. If the ProxyPushConsumer is already connected to a PushSupplier, then the \fICosEventChannelAdmin_AlreadyConnected\fR\& exception is raised\&.

This operation disconnects proxy push consumer from the event channel\&. Sends a notification about the loss of the connection to the push supplier attached to it, unless nil object reference was passed at the connection time\&.

This operation sends event data to all connected consumers via the event channel\&. If the event communication has already been disconnected, the \fICosEventComm_Disconnected\fR\& is raised\&.

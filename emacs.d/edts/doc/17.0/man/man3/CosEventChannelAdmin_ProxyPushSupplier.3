.TH CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushSupplier 3 "cosEvent 2.1.15" "Ericsson AB" "Erlang Module Definition"
.SH NAME
CosEventChannelAdmin_ProxyPushSupplier \- This module implements a ProxyPushSupplier interface which acts as a middleman between push consumer and the event channel.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The ProxyPushSupplier interface defines the second step for connecting push consumers to the event channel\&. A proxy supplier is similar to a normal supplier, but includes an additional method for connecting a consumer to the proxy supplier\&.
.LP
To get access to all definitions, e\&.g\&., exceptions, include necessary \fIhrl\fR\& files by using:
.br
\fI-include_lib("cosEvent/include/*\&.hrl")\&.\fR\&
.LP
Any object that possesses an object reference that supports the ProxyPushSupplier interface can perform the following operations:

This operation connects PushConsumer object to the ProxyPushSupplier object\&. If a nil object reference is passed CORBA standard \fIBAD_PARAM\fR\& exception is raised\&. If the ProxyPushSupplier is already connected to a PushConsumer, then the \fICosEventChannelAdmin_AlreadyConnected\fR\& exception is raised\&. Implementations of ProxyPushSuppliers may require additional interface functionality; if these requirements are not met the \fICosEventChannelAdmin_TypeError\fR\& exception will be raised\&.

This operation disconnects proxy push supplier from the event channel and sends a notification about the loss of the connection to the push consumer attached to it\&.

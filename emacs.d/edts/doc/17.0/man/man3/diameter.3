.SH NAME
diameter \- Main API of the diameter application.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module provides the interface with which a user can implement a Diameter node that sends and receives messages using the Diameter protocol as defined in RFC 6733\&.
.LP
Basic usage consists of creating a representation of a locally implemented Diameter node and its capabilities with \fBstart_service/2\fR\&, adding transport capability using \fBadd_transport/2\fR\& and sending Diameter requests and receiving Diameter answers with \fBcall/4\fR\&\&. Incoming Diameter requests are communicated as callbacks to a \fBdiameter_app(3)\fR\& callback modules as specified in the service configuration\&.
.LP
Beware the difference between \fIdiameter\fR\& (not capitalized) and \fIDiameter\fR\& (capitalized)\&. The former refers to the Erlang application named diameter whose main api is defined here, the latter to Diameter protocol in the sense of RFC 6733\&.
.LP
The diameter application must be started before calling most functions in this module\&.

Answers sent by diameter set the E-bit in the Diameter Header\&.

Since RFC 6733 allows both 3xxx and 5xxx result codes in an \fIanswer-message\fR\&, a transport with \fIdiameter_gen_base_rfc6733\fR\& as its common dictionary does distinguish between \fIanswer_3xxx\fR\& and \fIanswer\fR\&\&.

.SH NAME
CosNaming \- The CosNaming service is a collection of interfaces that together define the naming service.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The naming service provides the principal mechanism for clients to find objects in an ORB based world\&. The naming service provides an initial naming context that functions as the root context for all names\&. Given this context clients can navigate in the name space\&.
.LP
Types that are declared on the CosNaming level are:
.LP
.nf

typedef string Istring;
struct NameComponent {
      Istring id;  
      Istring kind;
};
  
typedef sequence <NameComponent> Name;
  
enum BindingType {nobject, ncontext};
  
struct Binding {
      Name    binding_name;
      BindingType binding_type;
};

typedef sequence <Binding> BindingList;
    
.fi
.LP
To get access to the record definitions for the structs use: \fI-include_lib("orber/COSS/CosNaming\&.hrl")\&.\fR\&\&.
.LP
Names are not an ORB object but the can be structured in components as seen by the definition above\&. There are no requirements on names so the service can support many different conventions and standards\&.
.LP
There are two different interfaces supported in the service:
.RS 2
.TP 2
*
NamingContext
.LP
.TP 2

BindingIterator

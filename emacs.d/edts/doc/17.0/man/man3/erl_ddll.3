erl_ddll \- Dynamic Driver Loader and Linker
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIerl_ddll\fR\& module provides an interface for loading and unloading \fIerlang linked in drivers\fR\& in runtime\&.
.LP

.RS -4
.B
Note:
.RE
This is a large reference document\&. For casual use of the module, as well as for most real world applications, the descriptions of the functions \fBload/2\fR\& and \fBunload/1\fR\& are enough to get going\&.

.LP
The driver should be provided as a dynamically linked library in a object code format specific for the platform in use, i\&. e\&. \fI\&.so\fR\& files on most Unix systems and \fI\&.ddl\fR\& files on windows\&. An erlang linked in driver has to provide specific interfaces to the emulator, so this module is not designed for loading arbitrary dynamic libraries\&. For further information about erlang drivers, refer to the ERTS reference manual section \fBerl_driver\fR\&\&.
.LP
When describing a set of functions, (i\&.e\&. a module, a part of a module or an application) executing in a process and wanting to use a ddll-driver, we use the term \fIuser\fR\&\&. There can be several users in one process (different modules needing the same driver) and several processes running the same code, making up several \fIusers\fR\& of a driver\&. In the basic scenario, each user loads the driver before starting to use it and unloads the driver when done\&. The reference counting keeps track of processes as well as the number of loads by each process, so that the driver will only be unloaded when no one wants it (it has no user)\&. The driver also keeps track of ports that are opened towards it, so that one can delay unloading until all ports are closed or kill all ports using the driver when it is unloaded\&.
.LP
The interface supports two basic scenarios of loading and unloading\&. Each scenario can also have the option of either killing ports when the driver is unloading, or waiting for the ports to close themselves\&. The scenarios are:
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fILoad and unload on a "when needed basis"\fR\&:
This (most common) scenario simply supports that each \fBuser\fR\& of the driver loads it when it is needed and unloads it when the \fBuser\fR\& no longer have any use for it\&. The driver is always reference counted and as long as a process keeping the driver loaded is still alive, the driver is present in the system\&.
.RS 2
.LP
Each \fBuser\fR\& of the driver use \fIliterally\fR\& the same pathname for the driver when demanding load, but the \fBusers\fR\& are not really concerned with if the driver is already loaded from the filesystem or if the object code has to be loaded from filesystem\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Two pairs of functions support this scenario:
.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIload/2 and unload/1\fR\&:
When using the \fIload/unload\fR\& interfaces, the driver will not \fIactually\fR\& get unloaded until the \fIlast port\fR\& using the driver is closed\&. The function \fIunload/1\fR\& can return immediately, as the \fBusers\fR\& are not really concerned with when the actual unloading occurs\&. The driver will actually get unloaded when no one needs it any longer\&.
.RS 2
.LP
If a process having the driver loaded dies, it will have the same effect as if unloading was done\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
When loading, the function \fIload/2\fR\& returns \fIok\fR\& as soon as there is any instance of the driver present, so that if a driver is waiting to get unloaded (due to open ports), it will simply change state to no longer need unloading\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fIload_driver/2 and unload_driver/1\fR\&:
These interfaces is intended to be used when it is considered an error that ports are open towards a driver that no \fBuser\fR\& has loaded\&. The ports still open when the last \fBuser\fR\& calls \fIunload_driver/1\fR\& or when the last process having the driver loaded dies, will get killed with reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\&\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The function names \fIload_driver\fR\& and \fIunload_driver\fR\& are kept for backward compatibility\&.
.RE
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fILoading and reloading for code replacement\fR\&:
This scenario occurs when the driver code might need replacement during operation of the Erlang emulator\&. Implementing driver code replacement is somewhat more tedious than beam code replacement, as one driver cannot be loaded as both "old" and "new" code\&. All \fBusers\fR\& of a driver must have it closed (no open ports) before the old code can be unloaded and the new code can be loaded\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The actual unloading/loading is done as one atomic operation, blocking all processes in the system from using the driver concerned while in progress\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The preferred way to do driver code replacement is to let \fIone single process\fR\& keep track of the driver\&. When the process start, the driver is loaded\&. When replacement is required, the driver is reloaded\&. Unload is probably never done, or done when the process exits\&. If more than one \fBuser\fR\& has a driver loaded when code replacement is demanded, the replacement cannot occur until the last "other" \fBuser\fR\& has unloaded the driver\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
Demanding reload when a reload is already in progress is always an error\&. Using the high level functions, it is also an error to demand reloading when more than one \fBuser\fR\& has the driver loaded\&. To simplify driver replacement, avoid designing your system so that more than than one \fBuser\fR\& has the driver loaded\&.
.RE
.RS 2
.LP
The two functions for reloading drivers should be used together with corresponding load functions, to support the two different behaviors concerning open ports:
.RE
.RS 2
.TP 2
.B
\fIload/2 and reload/2\fR\&:
This pair of functions is used when reloading should be done after the last open port towards the driver is closed\&.
.RS 2
.LP
As \fIreload/2\fR\& actually waits for the reloading to occur, a misbehaving process keeping open ports towards the driver (or keeping the driver loaded) might cause infinite waiting for reload\&. Timeouts has to be provided outside of the process demanding the reload or by using the low-level interface \fBtry_load/3\fR\& in combination with driver monitors (see below)\&.
.RE
.TP 2
.B
\fIload_driver/2 and reload_driver/2\fR\&:
This pair of functions are used when open ports towards the driver should be killed with reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& to allow for new driver code to get loaded\&.
.RS 2
.LP
If, however, another process has the driver loaded, calling \fIreload_driver\fR\& returns the error code \fIpending_process\fR\&\&. As stated earlier, the recommended design is to not allow other \fBusers\fR\& than the "driver reloader" to actually demand loading of the concerned driver\&.

Loads and links the dynamic driver \fIName\fR\&\&. \fIPath\fR\& is a file path to the directory containing the driver\&. \fIName\fR\& must be a sharable object/dynamic library\&. Two drivers with different \fIPath\fR\& parameters cannot be loaded under the same name\&. The \fIName\fR\& is a string or atom containing at least one character\&.
.LP
The \fIName\fR\& given should correspond to the filename of the actual dynamically loadable object file residing in the directory given as \fIPath\fR\&, but \fIwithout\fR\& the extension (i\&.e\&. \fI\&.so\fR\&)\&. The driver name provided in the driver initialization routine must correspond with the filename, in much the same way as erlang module names correspond to the names of the \fI\&.beam\fR\& files\&.
.LP
If the driver has been previously unloaded, but is still present due to open ports against it, a call to \fIload/2\fR\& will stop the unloading and keep the driver (as long as the \fIPath\fR\& is the same) and \fIok\fR\& is returned\&. If one actually wants the object code to be reloaded, one uses \fBreload/2\fR\& or the low-level interface \fBtry_load/3\fR\& instead\&. Please refer to the description of \fBdifferent scenarios\fR\& for loading/unloading in the introduction\&.
.LP
If more than one process tries to load an already loaded driver withe the same \fIPath\fR\&, or if the same process tries to load it several times, the function will return \fIok\fR\&\&. The emulator will keep track of the \fIload/2\fR\& calls, so that a corresponding number of \fIunload/2\fR\& calls will have to be done from the same process before the driver will actually get unloaded\&. It is therefore safe for an application to load a driver that is shared between processes or applications when needed\&. It can safely be unloaded without causing trouble for other parts of the system\&.
.LP
It is not allowed to load several drivers with the same name but with different \fIPath\fR\& parameters\&.
.LP

.RS -4

Note:
.RE
Note especially that the \fIPath\fR\& is interpreted literally, so that all loaders of the same driver needs to give the same \fIliteral\fR\&\fIPath\fR\& string, even though different paths might point out the same directory in the filesystem (due to use of relative paths and links)\&.

.LP
On success, the function returns \fIok\fR\&\&. On failure, the return value is \fI{error,ErrorDesc}\fR\&, where \fIErrorDesc\fR\& is an opaque term to be translated into human readable form by the \fBformat_error/1\fR\& function\&.

For more control over the error handling, again use the \fBtry_load/3\fR\& interface instead\&.

Works essentially as \fIload/2\fR\&, but will load the driver with other options\&. All ports that are using the driver will get killed with the reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& when the driver is to be unloaded\&.
.LP
The number of loads and unloads by different \fBusers\fR\& influence the actual loading and unloading of a driver file\&. The port killing will therefore only happen when the \fIlast\fR\& \fBuser\fR\& unloads the driver, or the last process having loaded the driver exits\&.
.LP
This interface (or at least the name of the functions) is kept for backward compatibility\&. Using \fBtry_load/3\fR\& with \fI{driver_options,[kill_ports]} \fR\& in the option list will give the same effect regarding the port killing\&.

This function creates a driver monitor and works in many ways as the function \fBerlang:monitor/2\fR\&, does for processes\&. When a driver changes state, the monitor results in a monitor-message being sent to the calling process\&. The \fIMonitorRef\fR\& returned by this function is included in the message sent\&.
.LP
As with process monitors, each driver monitor set will only generate \fIone single message\fR\&\&. The monitor is "destroyed" after the message is sent and there is then no need to call \fBdemonitor/1\fR\&\&.

\fIItem\fR\&:
The \fIItem\fR\& parameter specifies which driver one wants to monitor (the name of the driver) as well as which state change one wants to monitor\&. The parameter is a tuple of arity two whose first element is the driver name and second element is either of:

\fIloaded\fR\&:
Notify me when the driver is reloaded (or loaded if loading is underway)\&. It only makes sense to monitor drivers that are in the process of being loaded or reloaded\&.

When the function returns \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\& or \fI{ok, pending_process}\fR\&, one might want to get information about when the driver is \fIactually\fR\& loaded\&. This can be achieved by using the \fI{monitor, MonitorOption}\fR\& option\&.

When monitoring is requested, and a corresponding \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\& or \fI{ok, pending_process}\fR\& would be returned, the function will instead return a tuple \fI{ok, PendingStatus, reference()}\fR\& and the process will, at a later time when the driver actually gets loaded, get a monitor message\&.

The (possibly flattened) \fIPath\fR\& parameter must be consistent throughout the system, a driver should, by all \fBusers\fR\&, be loaded using the same \fIliteral\fR\&\fIPath\fR\&\&.

Currently the only allowed driver option is \fIkill_ports\fR\&, which means that all ports opened towards the driver are killed with the exit-reason \fIdriver_unloaded\fR\& when no process any longer has the driver loaded\&.

Only one \fIMonitorOption\fR\& can be specified and it is either the atom \fIpending\fR\&, which means that a monitor should be created whenever a load operation is delayed, and the atom \fIpending_driver\fR\&, in which a monitor is created whenever the operation is delayed due to open ports towards an otherwise unused driver\&. The \fIpending_driver\fR\& option is of little use, but is present for completeness, it is very well defined which reload-options might give rise to which delays\&.

If reloading is not requested, it might still be useful to specify the \fImonitor\fR\& option, as forced unloads (\fIkill_ports\fR\& driver option or the \fIkill_ports\fR\& option to \fBtry_unload/2\fR\&) will trigger a transient state where driver loading cannot be performed until all closing ports are actually closed\&. So, as \fItry_unload\fR\& can, in almost all situations, return \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\&, one should always specify at least \fI{monitor, pending_driver}\fR\& in production code (see the monitor discussion above)\&.

The \fIreload\fR\& option can be either the atom \fIpending\fR\&, in which reloading is requested for any driver and will be effectuated when \fIall\fR\& ports opened against the driver are closed\&. The replacement of the driver will in this case take place regardless of if there are still pending \fBusers\fR\& having the driver loaded! The option also triggers port-killing (if the \fIkill_ports\fR\& driver option is used) even though there are pending users, making it usable for forced driver replacement, but laying a lot of responsibility on the driver \fBusers\fR\&\&. The pending option is seldom used as one does not want other \fBusers\fR\& to have loaded the driver when code change is underway\&.

The more useful option is \fIpending_driver\fR\&, which means that reloading will be queued if the driver is \fInot\fR\& loaded by any other \fBusers\fR\&, but the driver has opened ports, in which case \fI{ok, pending_driver}\fR\& will be returned (a \fImonitor\fR\& option is of course recommended)\&.

This is the low level function to unload (or decrement reference counts of) a driver\&. It can be used to force port killing, in much the same way as the driver option \fIkill_ports\fR\& implicitly does, and it can trigger a monitor either due to other \fBusers\fR\& still having the driver loaded or that there are open ports using the driver\&.
.LP
Unloading can be described as the process of telling the emulator that this particular part of the code in this particular process (i\&.e\&. this \fBuser\fR\&) no longer needs the driver\&. That can, if there are no other users, trigger actual unloading of the driver, in which case the driver name disappears from the system and (if possible) the memory occupied by the driver executable code is reclaimed\&. If the driver has the \fIkill_ports\fR\& option set, or if \fIkill_ports\fR\& was specified as an option to this function, all pending ports using this driver will get killed when unloading is done by the last \fBuser\fR\&\&. If no port-killing is involved and there are open ports, the actual unloading is delayed until there are no more open ports using the driver\&. If, in this case, another \fBuser\fR\& (or even this user) loads the driver again before the driver is actually unloaded, the unloading will never take place\&.
.LP
To allow the \fBuser\fR\& that \fIrequests unloading\fR\& to wait for \fIactual unloading\fR\& to take place, \fImonitor\fR\& triggers can be specified in much the same way as when loading\&. As \fBusers\fR\& of this function however seldom are interested in more than decrementing the reference counts, monitoring is more seldom needed\&. If the \fIkill_ports\fR\& option is used however, monitor trigging is crucial, as the ports are not guaranteed to have been killed until the driver is unloaded, why a monitor should be triggered for at least the \fIpending_driver\fR\& case\&.

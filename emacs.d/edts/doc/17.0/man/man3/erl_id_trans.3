.SH NAME
erl_id_trans \- An Identity Parse Transform
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module performs an identity parse transformation of Erlang code\&. It is included as an example for users who may wish to write their own parse transformers\&. If the option \fI{parse_transform,Module}\fR\& is passed to the compiler, a user written function \fIparse_transform/2\fR\& is called by the compiler before the code is checked for errors\&.

.LP
Parse transformations are used if a programmer wants to use Erlang syntax, but with different semantics\&. The original Erlang code is then transformed into other Erlang code\&.

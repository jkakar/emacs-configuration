.SH NAME
erl_error \- Error Print Routines
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This module contains some error printing routines taken from \fIAdvanced Programming in the UNIX Environment\fR\& by W\&. Richard Stevens\&.
.LP
These functions are all called in the same manner as \fIprintf()\fR\&, i\&.e\&. with a string containing format specifiers followed by a list of corresponding arguments\&. All output from these functions is to \fIstderr\fR\&\&.

Use this function when a fatal error has occurred that is not due to a system call\&. The message provided by the caller is printed and the process terminates with an exit value of 1\&. The function does not return\&.

.SH "ERROR REPORTING"

.LP
Most functions in erl_interface report failures to the caller by returning some otherwise meaningless value (typically \fINULL\fR\& or a negative number)\&. As this only tells you that things did not go well, you will have to examine the error code in \fIerl_errno\fR\& if you want to find out more about the failure\&.
.SH EXPORTS
.LP
.B
volatile int erl_errno
.br
.RS
.LP
\fIerl_errno\fR\& is initially (at program startup) zero and is then set by many erl_interface functions on failure to a non-zero error code to indicate what kind of error it encountered\&. A successful function call might change \fIerl_errno\fR\& (by calling some other function that fails), but no function will ever set it to zero\&. This means that you cannot use \fIerl_errno\fR\& to see \fIif\fR\& a function call failed\&. Instead, each function reports failure in its own way (usually by returning a negative number or \fINULL\fR\&), in which case you can examine \fIerl_errno\fR\& for details\&.
.LP
\fIerl_errno\fR\& uses the error codes defined in your system\&'s \fI<errno\&.h>\fR\&\&.

Note:
.RE
Actually, \fIerl_errno\fR\& is a "modifiable lvalue" (just like ISO C defines \fIerrno\fR\& to be) rather than a variable\&. This means it might be implemented as a macro (expanding to, e\&.g\&., \fI*_erl_errno()\fR\&)\&. For reasons of thread- (or task-)safety, this is exactly what we do on most platforms\&.

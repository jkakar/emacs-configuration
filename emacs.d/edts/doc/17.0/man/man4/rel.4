.SH NAME
rel \- Release resource file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fIrelease resource file\fR\& specifies which applications are are included in a release (system) based on Erlang/OTP\&.
.LP
This file is used by the functions in \fIsystools\fR\& when generating start scripts (\fI\&.script\fR\&, \fI\&.boot\fR\&) and release upgrade files (\fIrelup\fR\&)\&.
.SH "FILE SYNTAX"

.LP
The release resource file should be called \fIName\&.rel\fR\&\&.
.LP
The \fI\&.rel\fR\& file contains one single Erlang term, which is called a \fIrelease specification\fR\&\&. The file has the following syntax:
.LP
.nf

{release, {RelName,Vsn}, {erts, EVsn},
  [{Application, AppVsn} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type} |
   {Application, AppVsn, IncApps} |
   {Application, AppVsn, Type, IncApps}]}.

\fIRelName = string()\fR\& is the name of the release\&.

\fIVsn = string()\fR\& is the version of the release\&.

\fIEVsn = string()\fR\& is the version of ERTS the release is intended for\&.

\fIApplication = atom()\fR\& is the name of an application included in the release\&.

\fIAppVsn = string()\fR\& is the version of an application included in the release\&.
.LP

\fIType = permanent | transient | temporary | load | none\fR\& is the start type of an application included in the release\&.
.RS 2
.LP
If \fIType = permanent | transient | temporary\fR\&, the application will be loaded and started in the corresponding way, see \fIapplication(3)\fR\&\&. If \fIType = load\fR\&, the application will only be loaded\&. If \fIType = none\fR\&, the application will be neither loaded nor started, although the code for its modules will be loaded\&. Defaults to \fIpermanent\fR\&

\fIIncApps = [atom()]\fR\& is a list of applications that are included by an application included in the release\&.
.RS 2
.LP
The list must be a subset of the included applications specified in the application resource file (\fIApplication\&.app\fR\&) and overrides this value\&. Defaults to the same value as in the application resource file\&.

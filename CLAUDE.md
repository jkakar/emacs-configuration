# Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my Emacs configuration.

## Configuration

The configuration is written in `init.org` using literate programming with org-babel. The `init.el` file is generated by tangling `init.org`.

To regenerate `init.el` after editing `init.org`:

```
M-x org-babel-tangle
```

Or evaluate: `(org-babel-tangle-file "init.org")`

## Package Management

Packages are managed with straight.el and use-package. Run `M-x straight-pull-all` to update packages, then `M-x straight-freeze-versions` to lock versions.

## Coding Conventions

- Custom elisp functions should use the `jkakar/` prefix (e.g., `jkakar/minibuffer-yank-word`)
- Never run `org-babel-tangle` automatically. Always ask the user to run it manually after making changes to `init.org`.
